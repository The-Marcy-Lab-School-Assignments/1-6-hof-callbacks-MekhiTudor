# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

An inline function is a function, inside the scope (or block) of another function. For ex:

```jsx
arr.map((myFuction(), param2) => myFunction() + param2;)
```

# Teacher Feedback

In the future answer all parts of the question, you are missing an example! An inline function is one that is written in the same line as a function invocation.
