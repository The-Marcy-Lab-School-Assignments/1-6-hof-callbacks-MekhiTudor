~~In the future answer all parts of the question, you are missing an example! An inline function is one that is written in the same line as a function invocation.~~

Your definition is correct! Here is an example of what that could look like: 

`const screamAtEveryone = (msg, () => {`${msg}.toUpperCase()`});` 

Notice that I am not invoking my **callback** function anywhere!
