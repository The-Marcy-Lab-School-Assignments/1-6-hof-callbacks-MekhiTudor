# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
It's getting invoked with the `.forEach()` method instead of `.map()`. 

# Teacher Feedback

~~Not quite! It is actually because it is getting invoked within the forEach higher order method!~~

While you are correct in that we should be using map here rather than forEach, it is actually becasue of line 7. We don't ever want to invoke the function when it is a callback function being passed in!
