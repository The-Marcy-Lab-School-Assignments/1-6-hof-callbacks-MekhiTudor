# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
There isn't anything being passed into the `printDouble` function. So that's why its not working as expected.

# Teacher Feedback

Not quite! It is actually because it is getting invoked within the forEach higher order method!
